#Recruitment Day Katas setup script

This document explains how to setup a recruitment machine.



##Where on the drive are Recruitment Katas stored?

Recruitment files are stored on the Desktop. 

For example:

C:\Users\tvp\Desktop\candidate-java-1
C:\Users\tvp\Desktop\candidate-javascript-1



##Preparing the machine:

###1) Before you start with setting up a new candidate make sure that previous candidate files are deleted from the Desktop. 

###2) Decide which programming languages you will need on a machine. For this readme we will setup one javascript candidate and one java.

###3) Run setup-javascript.bat and wait until it finishes

###4) Runfor each language setup-java.bat and wait until it finishes



#### The setup scripts, once initiated, will create maximum of 2 candidate directories per programming language. Ie. it's not possible to create 3 java directories at the same time. 

#### The setup scripts sole purpose is to setup the directory structure and copy required files.

  - Java installed on the machine
